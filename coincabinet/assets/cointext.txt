&tray4_coin1=<font face="Arial" size="13">The first two Mughal emperors, Akbar and Jahangir, were not strict Muslims.

Islamic dates start when the prophet <font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/m/muhammad.html','muha')"><u>Muhammad</u></a></font> fled to Medina in 622 AD, an event known as the Hijra, meaning 'flight.'<br><br>In addition, the Islamic calendar is based on <font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/l/lunaryear.html','luny')"><u>the lunar year</u></a></font>, making it eleven days shorter.

&tray2_coin1=<font face="Arial" size="13">Coins are symbolic of wealth and power.

&tray2_coin7=<font face="Arial" size="13">This ordinary looking coin is significant because it illustrates how the Mughal <font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/c/currency.html','curr')"><u>currency</u></a></font> ranged from low value copper coins such as this, to larger and much more valuable gold coins.

&tray1_coin6=<font face="Arial" size="13">Akbar created a new religion centred on himself, which combined features of several other faiths.

&tray5_coin2=<font face="Arial" size="13">Britain's interest in India became increasingly more political, and by 1834, the influence of the British <font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/e/eastindia.html','east')"><u>East India Company</u></a></font> extended over most of India.<br><br>In 1835 a <font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/u/uniform.html','unif')"><u>uniform</u></a></font> coinage was issued, which clearly shows how the British attitude had changed from wanting to adopt local traditions, to <font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/i/imposing.html','impo')"><u>imposing</u></a></font> Western ideas.<br><br>This coin looks very much like an English coin with the name of the English monarch in the place of the Mughal emperor's name.</font>

&tray5_coin4=<font face="Arial" size="13">Although the Portuguese were the first Europeans to settle in India, it was not long until others followed.The French set up an East India trading company in 1664, and established themselves on the southern coast.<br><br>Unlike the system under the Mughals, southern India was organized into small states and any merchant could be given the right to coin money.<br><br>The French <font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/m/minting.html','mint')"><u>minted</u></a></font> their own version of the pagoda, which was the local gold coinage and shows a picture of an Indian god, a form of <font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/v/vishnu.html','vish')"><u>Vishnu</u></a></font>.

&tray5_coin6=<font face="Arial" size="13">Not all coins minted in India were used for buying and selling.

&tray5_coin7=<font face="Arial" size="13">The British were not the only ones who tried to copy Indian coins. Because Nepal had strong trade links with north-eastern India, they minted coins like this one in the sixteenth century, based on the silver coins of the Bengal <font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/s/sultanate.html','sult')"><u>Sultanate</u></a></font>.<br><br>The coin does not contain any images of humans because these were traditionally forbidden by Islam and the Nepalese wanted their coins to be acceptable to their Muslim traders.<br><br>However, they do contain other religious symbols that the Buddhist and Hindu people of Nepal would have recognized immediately.

&tray5_coin8=<font face="Arial" size="13">When the British first settled in India, they brought foreign coins with them that were then <font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/r/reminted.html','remi')"><u>re-minted</u></a></font> into Mughal rupees.<br><br>From 1672 they struck their own coins using European designs, but these were limited to use in areas which the <font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/e/eastindia.html','east')"><u>East India Company</u></a></font> had some influence over. To overcome this, the British tried to adopt Mughal coin designs, replacing the Mughal emperor's name with their English monarch's. This infuriated the Mughal emperor, Aurangzeb (1658-1707) and he forced the Company to stop the practice.<br><br>This coin has been minted in the name of William III.</font>

&tray5_coin9=<font face="Arial" size="13">The English settled in Surat in 1611 and began to expand both their trade and control in India.

From here, coins were minted like this silver rupee of 1677 which includes the arms and title of the king, Charles II. Mainly copper and zinc coins were produced, to serve its local needs. </font>

&tray5_coin10=<font face="Arial" size="13">Mughal power declined during the eighteenth century. Local princes took control of their own districts again, and began to mint their own silver rupees.

&tray3_coin1=<font face="Arial" size="13">If money 'talks' and coins are symbolic of wealth, then this coin speaks volumes!
